# OM_FIREWALL
Open-source hardware project of firewall

I am starting (30.06.2017) a hardware firewall project that I have to implement its implementations into the logic circuit. The project is designed to be fully functional on the hardware layer giving you the ability to use a firewall for highest security levels. The project is based on the MIT license giving users unlimited use, copying, modification and distribution (including sale) of the original or modified program in binary or source form. The only requirement is that all versions retain the license terms and author information.
